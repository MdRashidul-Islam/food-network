        <p>It’s no secret that the amount of calories people eat and drink has a direct impact on their weight: Consume the same number of calories that the body burns over time, and weight stays stable. Consume more than the body burns, weight goes up. Less, weight goes down. But what about the type of calories: Does it matter whether they come from specific nutrients-fat, protein, or carbohydrate? Specific foods-whole grains or potato chips.</p>

            <h2>One Pot Thai-Style Rice Noodles</h2>
            <p>These One Pot Spicy Thai Noodles are SO easy, essentially one pot, but you can cook it in a skillet too. That is the catch – if you cook it in a skillet, it’s going to be 2 pots because you have to cook the noodles first.</p>

            <h2>Spatchcock Chicken</h2>
            <P>he term “spatchcock” is derived from an old Irish abbreviation of “dispatching the cock”. It’s a cooking method involving cutting out the backbone of the chicken so it cooks flat, resulting in a faster, more evenly cooked chicken with crispier skin. This Spatchcock Chicken recipe is probably one of my favorite things to make for dinner (with leftovers to use in a variety of ways for lunch or dinner the next day!). It’s on .</P>
